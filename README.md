# TwoReelRepo
Two Reel Pretedermined Outcome Slot Machine Written in .NET Framework For University of Lincoln, 2015. 

Hey all, this is the start of my contributions to a project I created here - it is a two-reel virtual slot machine written in VB -
the slot machine demo is available now so you can have a play and see what it's like. 

It has a set of predetermined outcomes that are decided on by a 'Select Case' method - it was specifically designed with a set of
outcomes in mind. It has the ability to adjust some settings within a session, but please note, changing these settings (such as reel spin 
speed) will only affect that instance of the launcher - it won't carry on to the next you close/open it.

I will be updating this README with instructions but for now, enjoy the machine!
